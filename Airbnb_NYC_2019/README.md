# Airbnb-NYC-2019 Analysis


This is my analysis process. I did it basically by MySQL and visualization parts were done in Tableau.

[MY SQL SCRIPT](https://github.com/levuthuynga/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Airbnb_NYC_2019/Airbnb_NYC_2019.sql)

Here are 4 steps of this analysis:
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze

## Context
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.

[DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)

## I. Ask

Analysis goal: make suggestions on marketing plan based on differences between 5 boroughs (neighbourhood_group)

## II. Prepare
### 1. Information about Data Source

- Generated by respondents from a distributed survey via Insider of Airbnb and published on Inside Airbnb.
- 48895 different name listings on Airbnb from New York and 16 different attributes.

### 2. Limitation of Dataset
Data was collected in New York only, from 2011 to 2019. Therefore analysis results might not be timely or apply to other areas.

### 3. Information about columns
1. id -> Airbnb Listing ID
2. name -> Airbnb Listing Name
3. host_id -> Host ID who is hosting the Airbnb Listing
4. host_name -> Host Name who is hosting the Airbnb Listing
5. neighbourhood_group -> Name of Borough in New York
6. neighbourhood -> Name of Neighbourhood in New York
7. latitude -> Latitude of Airbnb Listing
8. longitude -> Longitude of Airbnb Listing
9. room_type -> Type of Room
10. price -> Price of that particular Airbnb Listing for one night, in US dollars
11. minimum_nights -> Minimum number of nights to stay for that particular Airbnb Listing
12. number_of_reviews -> Number of Reviews of that particular Airbnb Listing
13. last_review -> Date of the last review of that particular listing 
14. reviews_per_month -> Average Reviews each month
15. calculated_host_listings_count -> Number of times Host have hosted a listing
16. availability_365 -> A listing will be counted as available, if the host isn't using or renovating or other guests have booked it, calculated for all year in 2019.

## III. Process
### 1. Import Data to MySQL
48895 rows imported by LOAD DATA INFILE command

### 2. Detect abnormalities (outliers, null, empty values...)
#### Outliers

![Outliers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94755091/148875183-c2a80ed9-013a-4f83-9911-74cee46db553.png)

- Price: outliers are values that >1400. I double-checked the price on Airbnb website, a luxurious entire home/apt might cost 1000-2600$. Therefore I convert all the >3000 value to 3000
- Minimum_nights: values >400. Airbnb has a different policy for guests who want to rent for a long time, and there's no maximum. I suppose those values are possible, so I left it there
- Number_of_reviews: values >594. There's only 3 rows, I decide to drop
- Reviews_per_month: values >14. Seem quite impossible, I decide to drop
- Calculated_host_listings_count: values >91. There's no duplicate listing location, so I left it there
- Available_365 : no outlier, but too many listings busy all year (17533 listings), not reliable

#### Null and empty cells
- Name: 16 empty cells. Name column doesn't affect my analysis much, left it there
- Host_name: 21 empty cells. Same with Name
- Last_review: 10052 empty cells
- Reviews_per_month: 10052 empty cells. 
Last_review is empty results in reviews_per_month is empty, too. That means this listing never has a review. 
Last_review may not affects much, leave it there. Set reviews_per_month empty cells to 0 and change data type to decimal

#### Actions
- Convert Price outliers to 3000
- Drop rows where number_of_reviews and reviews_per_month have outliers, 16 rows total
- Update reviews_per_month zero value and change data type.

## IV. Analyze
### 1. Assumptions: 
1. Find differences in
- Number of listings, each type of them and average price
- Minimum nights guests stay there
- Number of guests
2. I assume that each guest will write a review after they rent the listings, so I multiply reviews_per_month to 12 to calculate how many guests they have in a year, in average
3. I suppose that reviews_per_month equal number_of_reviews divide number of months since the first review they've ever had (that's why those that have 0 reviews have it empty in the reviews_per_month column instead of 0). So I can calculate how long a from the first review a listing ever had, let assume that's not long after they register

### 2. Findings
1. Brooklyn and Manhattan have more listings, as they are have more tourist attractions
2. Average price in Manhattan is much higher than others
3. Highest percentage of listings in Manhattan is entire home/apt while others are private room
4. Average minimum nights in Brooklyn are 6 and Manhattan are more than 8, while others are 4.5 - 5.2
5. Brooklyn and Manhattan have quite the same num_of_guests, Queens is half of them, the other two are smaller. Compare this with number of listings, one host in Queens, Bronx and Staten Island must welcome more guests than Manhattan and Brooklyn hosts in average 
7. Number of listings recent years in Queens, Bronx and Staten Island have increased more than others, in relative numbers

## V. Suggestions
Encourage longer trips to Queens, Bronx on days such as US Open tennis tournament or baseball season, and Staten Island is suitable for family trips or fans of history and architecture. These boroughs are cheaper and have more rental choices than before
-> Need more data about cost and revenue to confirm and consolidate this suggestion
